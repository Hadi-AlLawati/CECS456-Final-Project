## Group 3: Online Shoppers Intention
The goal is to explain what actions of customer browsing on an e-commerce website will contribute to that customer buying a product. You will be using clustering and classification algorithms to make predictive models around shoppers’ intentions. ￼  
1.	Perform exploratory data analysis and data pre-processing.
a.	There are missing values in the dataset. One way of handlining missing values is to perform imputation, but in certain cases we can also drop them. How you want to treat the missing values? Handle categorical variables using one-hot encoding. 
b.	Plot the histogram of the features and boxplot for outlier detection,  
c.	Plot the correlation matrix for the features. 
d.	Provide a list of top 10 most important features. 
2.	The dataset contains 18 features. Your task is to use Principal Component Analysis (reduce the number of variables of a data set). 
3.	Design a machine learning algorithm to identify the behavior of customers if they are going to purchase the product or not.
a.	Use k-nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes, logistic regression, SVM, and Random Forest classification algorithm to create online shopper intention (target variable: Is_Revenue).
b.	Compare the performance metrics of the classification algorithms.
c.	Plot ROC graph for the algorithms 
4.	Suggested a few possible ways to attract more customers to finish with purchasing.
